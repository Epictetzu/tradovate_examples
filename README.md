# tradovate_examples
Two examples to demonstrate the differences in complexity between seemingly simple apps.

### main.rs
The main file for a simple multithreaded trading bot using live market data and account events.

### ninjatrader_mirror.rs
The main file from a very simple app that replicates orders placed in Tradovate to a localally running Ninjatrader app using only account events. This turned out to work better
than I would have hoped. Very fast.

This gif shows how many server events there are.

This gif shows most of the different endpoints there are to deal with from Tradovate
